QUICK IMPORTANT INSTRUMENTS GUIDE
(look at QuickStartUpGuide.pdf too)
    
- ARK-11 ADF:
  - I and II located at Navigator's workplace, second I on overhead; like R-802 with memory device (buttons 1-9)
    - Push down the upper "P"-button from the left section of memory buttons -> device now ready to set frequencies
    - Set desired frequency by left knob: frequency ranges, middle one: rough setting, right upper one: fine tuning
    - Push one memory button 1-9 to store frequency*; station, frequency and range should appear on table; repeat as desired
    - With "P"-button pushed again (up), pressing memory buttons will "recall" set frequencies
  - ARK-11 modes:
    - "Comp. 1" and "Comp. 2": like "ADF" mode, frame/loop antenna turns automatically, to/from known
    - "Ant.": guess!
    - "Frame": manual turning of frame/loop antenna by l-r-antenna switch, volume and instrument above indicate direction, to/from unknown
  - You can switch between the navigator's and the pilots' (overhead) control panel by pressing the lower right button
* Not as in RL; see R-802

- AP-28l1 Autopilot
  - Located at back of middle console
  - Power on by, well, "AP Power ON"
  - Connect by either pressing "d" or big button -> Wing level* and Pitch Hold will connect first
  - Disconnect by pressing "d" again
  - Some transfers from one mode to another need pressing big button again
  - In "GIK Roll Mode", Heading can be controlled by knob of ZK
* Should be Roll Hold I think?

- Anti-Ice System
  - On F/O's right console: PPD pitot and static port heating; up position: ON; middle: OFF; down: control
    - Left switch: Pitot A1 (pilot's KUS-730) and static ports S1 and S5 (pilot's KUS-730, VAR-30 and UVO-15)
    - Middle switch: Pitot A2 (FDR and emergency pitot for A1) and static port S3 (FDR)
    - Right switch: Pitot A3 (F/O's KUS-730) and static ports S2 and S6 (F/O's KUS-730, VAR-30 and UVID-15 and UVPD-15)
    - Upper switch: Static ports S4 and S7 (altitude correction KV-11)
  - At bottom of F/O's right panel:
    - 2x right window (low and intense); astrocompass*; wing, tail and nose; prop hub and blades
  - At bottom of pilot's left panel:
    - 2x right window (low and intense)
* not on this plane!

- Pitot and Static Port Pressure valves
  - On pilot's left console:
    - Back one: A1 -> A2*
    - Front one: S1 and S5* -> E1 (emergency port in radar chamber)
  - On F/O's right console (one red lever):
    - S2 and S6* -> E2 (emergency port in radar chamber)
* also see "Anti-Ice System"
